          <mat-panel-title> What is a WebP file? </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="text-left-align">Google introduced the WebP format to help speed up loading times on the internet. WebP
          enables websites to showcase
          high-quality images while maintaining smaller file sizes compared to traditional formats like PNG and JPEG.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left-align">
          Users have the option to save WebP files with either lossless or lossy compression. This means images can be
          compressed
          without losing data or by losing only some non-essential details. According to Google's developers, lossless WebP
          images
          can be up to 26% smaller than PNGs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left-align">
          You can easily identify a WebP image by its .WEBP extension.

          <mat-panel-title> Whatâ€™s the difference between WebP and JPEG files? </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="text-left-align">Both file formats compress images to facilitate sharing and storage. However, WebP files
          are typically much smaller than
          traditional JPEGs. According to Google's developers, a WebP image with lossy compression can be 25% to 34% smaller
          than
          a similar JPEG file.

          <mat-panel-title> Does WebP work on all browsers? </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="text-left-align">After years of progress and refinement, most web browsers now support the WebP format.
          However, some browsers, such as
          Internet Explorer, might still have difficulty handling WebP files. It's always a good idea to check Google's most
          recent compatibility list.

          <mat-panel-title> Is WebP an open-source file format? </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="text-left-align">WebP is an open-source format, allowing anyone to contribute to its development and
          improvements. Since its launch in
          2010, Google's developers have actively encouraged users to provide feedback and suggestions.

        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="text-left-align">WebP images have a maximum size of 16,383 x 16,383 pixels. It's important to keep this in
          mind when adding WebP images
          to a website or other platforms.

          <mat-panel-title> Are WebP images raster or vector files? </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p class="text-left-align">WebP images fall under the category of raster files. Raster files are one of the two
          primary types of image files, the
          other being vector files. The key distinction between them is that raster files are made up of individual pixels,
          while
          vector graphics are composed of mathematical equations and paths.
